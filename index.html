<strong>Hello World..</strong>
<br>
<p>we're still a work in progress. Be sure to check out the Github repo and <a href="https://github.com/decentech/working-open/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md">Code of Conduct</a> for more info.</p>
<p>Uniting open source decentralised projects and helping them engage the wider community. <br> By providing regular streamed and in person meetups, we seek to educate, overview, and workshop<br> to build personal skills and drive active contributors to these ground breaking technologies.</p>
<p>I'm working open because it's the way decentralisation works. People help, learn, problem solve, and build awesome things together. <p>
